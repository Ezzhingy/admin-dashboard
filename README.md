**Full browser dashboard design**

A fictitious company (Prosperity) was used as a placeholder to fill in the website template created.

Created with HTML and CSS. From this project, I learned how to:
- Layout a web page by combining both CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Manipulate SVGs and different positioning techniques
- Utilize static, relative, and dynamic units
- Responsively expand or shrink a section when resizing the browser window
